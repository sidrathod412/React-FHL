# Fun Exercise: React Router Hunt

## Objective:
In this exercise, you will create a simple React application using React Router to navigate between different pages. Each page will contain a clue that will help you complete the hunt. 

## Task
The goal is to find all the clues and piece them together to form the final answer. Basically you will start at the first route, which will contain a component with a clue that guides you to the next route (navigation item) that you need to navigate to in order to find the second clue, and eventually reach the final route. 

You can copy the styling from the demo to save time.

## Example 

Here is an example "clue" route, you can create the same one or you can also be creative with your clues!

Route 1: Your start component that will include the first clue "I resemble happiness and I rhyme with fellow" which answer will guide you to the next component.
Route 2: Your "yellow component" that will include a clue "You guessed the first route right! Onto the next one: I am soft and i am micro, visit me but dont be hard on me!".
Route 3: Your "microsoft component" that will include the last clue "Hello there! are you ready to reach the final step? Ready, set, ...!"
Route 4: Your "go component" that will include a final message "You made it! React routing is so much fun!"

Happy coding!
